.SH NAME
scoutfs \- overview and mount options for the scoutfs filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
A scoutfs filesystem is stored on two block devices.  Multiple mounts of
the filesystem are supported between hosts that share access to the
block device.  A new filesystem is created with the
.B mkfs
command in the
.BR scoutfs (8)
utility.
.SH MOUNT OPTIONS
The following mount options are supported by scoutfs in addition to the
general mount options described in the
.BR mount (8)
manual page.
.TP
.B metadev_path=<device>
The metadev_path option specifies the path to the block device that
contains the filesystem's metadata.
.sp
This option is required.
.TP
.B quorum_slot_nr=<number>
The quorum_slot_nr option assigns a quorum member slot to the mount.
The mount will use the slot assignment to claim exclusive ownership of
the slot's configured address and an associated metadata device block.
Each slot number must be used by only one mount at any given time.
.sp
When a mount is assigned a quorum slot it becomes a quorum member and
will participate in the raft leader election process and could start
the server for the filesystem if it is elected leader.
.sp
The assigned number must match one of the slots defined with \-Q options
when the filesystem was created with mkfs.  If the number assigned
doesn't match a number created during mkfs then the mount will fail.
.SH VOLUME OPTIONS
Volume options are persistent options which are stored in the super
block in the metadata device and which apply to all mounts of the volume.
.sp
Volume options may be initially specified as the volume is created
as described in the mkfs command in
.BR scoutfs (8).
.sp
Volume options may be changed at runtime by writing to files in sysfs
while the volume is mounted.  Volume options are found in the
volume_options/ directory with a file for each option.  Reading the
file provides the current setting of the option and an empty string
is returned if the option is not set.  To set the option, write
the new value ofthe option to the file.  To clear the option, write
a blank line with a newline to the file.  The write syscall will
return an error if the set operation fails and a message will be written
to the console.
.sp
The following volume options are supported:

.SH FURTHER READING
A
.B scoutfs
filesystem can detect corruption at runtime.  A catalog of kernel log
messages that indicate corruption can be found in
.BR scoutfs-corruption (8)
